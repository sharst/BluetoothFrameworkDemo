# BluetoothFrameworkDemo #

This is an example Android-Application that demonstrates one possible use-case of the BluetoothFramework Library, which is also published here. 

The code should be pretty self-explanatory, but will be commented more thoroughly in the future. 

It's capabilities are visible when used in combination with the Python Demo Application.
